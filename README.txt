This is a python wrapper for the Sankyo GNU/Linux code for interfacing with
the Sankyo SHT610 Card Dispenser.  It is a USB HID device and the code
interfaces with it via libusb 0.1.12.  If you are on a Debian-derivative, you
can install it like this:

	apt-get install libusb-dev make build-essential bsdtar

Then untar the Rel_SHT.tar.gz file directly in this folder.
